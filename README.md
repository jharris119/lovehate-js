lovehate-js
===========

There's this game we play in improv class that's called Love-Hate. You have a bunch of people in the class, and each person secretly picks one classmate who they "love" and another classmate who they "hate". Your goal is to stay as close as possible to the person you love and simultaneously as far as possible from the person you hate. From a perch above the stage, sometimes you get some interesting patterns as people chase each other around the room and end up as a massive improv lump in a corner or circling around a central point. Sometimes you don't get interesting patterns.

This here's a JavaScript implementation of said game. Each circle is a player, the pink arrow points to who they love and the black arrow points to who they hate.

There's a variation on this game called Protector —— you secretly choose a "protector" and an "enemy" and your job is to keep your protector in a direct line between you and your enemy. The trigonometry on that seems harder to comprehend, so I'm probably not going to put that one into action.
